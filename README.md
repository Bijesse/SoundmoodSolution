Soundmood
=========

ScriptEd Year 2 Curriculum project - Using the Souncloud API

### Do Now:

- What mood are you in and what song would you use to represent your mood?
- Create an array of emotions (in JSbin?)... Perhaps we can even ask them to randomly select a mood from this array. If they're up to it.

### Part 1:

**What is an API? How do we use an API?**
- As a group, find SC.stream to play a song

### Part 2:

**Using click handlers**
- For the most part, these kids are pros at this. Maybe just a quick refresher and them letting them complete on their own.

### Part 3:

**SC.get**
- Grabbing and playing a song based on the mood typed in.

### Part 4:

**Randomization**
- A random button with the array of emotions to play a song.

### Bonus Challenges

- Change the color of the jumbotron according to the user's mood
- Add a Bootstrap typeahead to the mood input field
