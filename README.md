Soundmood
=========

ScriptEd Year 2 Curriculum project - Using the Souncloud API

### Project description

* **Search**: Simply type in the mood you are currently in and a song will be generated based on that mood
* **Hear**: We grab all of our songs directly from Soundcloud, so there are millions of selections.
* **Explore**: Using Soundmood, you can find hundreds of songs based on unique mood
* **Quantity &amp; Quality**: Soundmood has a selection of 284 different emotions/mood, so good luck entering one that doesn't exist.

=======

### Do Now:

- What mood are you in and what song would you use to represent your mood?
- Create an array of emotions (in JSbin?)... Perhaps we can even ask them to randomly select a mood from this array. If they're up to it.

### 1. What is an API? How do we use an API?

- As a group, find SC.stream to play a song

### 2. Using click handlers

- For the most part, these kids are pros at this. Maybe just a quick refresher and them letting them complete on their own.

### 3. SC.get

- Grabbing and playing a song based on the mood typed in.

### 4. Randomization

- A random button with the array of emotions to play a song.

### Bonus Challenges

- Change the color of the jumbotron according to the user's mood
- Add a Bootstrap typeahead to the mood input field
